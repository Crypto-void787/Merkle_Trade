# Currency-Trading-Exchange-

A console-based cryptocurrency trading platform built in C++ as part of my Object-Oriented Programming journey. This project demonstrates practical use of OOP principles, file I/O, exception handling, and object interactions to model a simplified trading system

💫Key Features

👉🏻 Interactive Console Interface: Menu-driven user interactions with real-time responses.

👉🏻 OrderBookEntry Class: Models trading data with appropriate data types and functions.

👉🏻 CSVReader Class: File I/O for reading and parsing trade data, with exception handling.

👉🏻 Order Matching Engine: Iterates over trade orders, processes user inputs, and calculates basic statistics.

👉🏻 Wallet Class: Demonstrates object interactions, static vs. non-static methods, and real-world modeling.

💫Tech Stack

👉🏻 Language: C++

👉🏻 Tools: IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or similar)

👉🏻 Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming

💫 Project Goals

👉🏻 Learn object-oriented programming (OOP) principles through a real-world project.

👉🏻 Build a modular, interactive, and testable currency trading platform from scratch.

👉🏻 Practice using C++ for data handling, file I/O, algorithms, and object interactions.
